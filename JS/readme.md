# JavaScript

There are multiple files here, one is [jQuery] oriented, the other Vanilla JavaScript with [ES6]. If you already have [jQuery], use it, otherwise use the Vanilla stuff in yout TypeScript or regular JS files. For the Vanilla file, put it at the bottom of the page to leverage `onload`

## USAGE

In each file there is way more code than you need, so cut-and-paste accordingly.

## Coverage

As of this writing (June 21 2020) both jQuery and VanillaJS have fixes for form labels, tab index, adds titles to iframes, and adding missing alt attributes.
