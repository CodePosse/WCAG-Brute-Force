# WCAG-Brute-Force
Brute force WCAG AA patching to pass Wave tool tests.

## Overview
This is a file I am making using CSS and jQuery :poop: to help patch a site quickly for the purpose of attempting 508 WCAG AA compliance. It is unlikely to fix everything, but it can help a ton.

Please let me know if you'd like to contribute, this is based mainly on what I currently deal with.

### Indemnification
I make no warranty that this will fix everything, but there is a lot it can help with.

## CSS
In CSS I am adding a lot of things, there are comments to what a line is and does, and I use plenty of advanced selectors and pseudo classes. I don't always peovide the actual use samples, but you should be able to understand from the comments.

## JavaScript
Ok, jQuery is used, it is ubiquitous so it is easy to use. Most of what I do here are attribute manipulations and those generally work from early versions on to the modern releases.

I will be adding Vanilla JavaScript to this, but for speed, I want to get the logic down first.
